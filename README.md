# CodeSplash
***Hello guys and welcome back to my account.✋✋✋

There has been several discussions on how to set up this framework and I think this is the simplest php framework to set up.It also has a developed env parser from scratch and easy to implement.You can follow the programming from scratch from my youtube channel.<a href="youtube.com">follow up</a>

# instructions
First make sure that php is installed in your machine.Navigate to the target dir of CodeSplash, in your terminal simply type:
<h3 style="color:brown; width:100%; box-shadow: 2px 2px 3px black;">php splash serve</h3>
This will make fire up the app at once.
Go to any browser and open the port at which it is served.
<h3 style="color:green">Let's have a preview of the framework.</h3>

This is a php framework used to simplify projects, saves time and is used to make elegant and robust systems which are secure.
